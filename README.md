# Express to AWS Lambda
## What is this?
This repo provides examples of [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) apps using the [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless). It contains basic Nodejs apps that use Express framework and the equivalent app on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) using the [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless).

## Why
AWS Lambda and other compute services (Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, ect), are playing an increasingly more important role in Application Architecture.

When I first looked at AWS Lambda it was very unclear to me how to structure and deploy a Lambda based application. I'm hoping these examples will help others that want to learn more about AWS Lambda and the Serverless Framework.

## Examples
Each branch has a different example.

1. [Getting started - basic request and response](https://github.com/johncmckim/express-to-aws-lambda/tree/1-basic)
2. [Request Templates](https://github.com/johncmckim/express-to-aws-lambda/tree/2-request-templates)
3. [Response Templates](https://github.com/johncmckim/express-to-aws-lambda/tree/3-response-templates)
4. [Authentication](https://github.com/johncmckim/express-to-aws-lambda/tree/4-authentication)
5. Events - Coming Soon

## Reading
If you want to dig deeper into AWS Lambda and Serverless. I recommend reading the documentation for both services.
* [AWS Lambda Docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)
* [AWS API Gateway Docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html)
