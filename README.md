# Express to AWS Lambda
## What is this?
This repo provides examples of [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) apps using the [Serverless Framework](http://serverless.com/) and [Apex Framework](http://apex.run/). It contains basic Nodejs apps that use Express framework and the equivalent app on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

## Why
AWS Lambda and other compute services (Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, ect), are playing an increasingly more important role in Application Architecture.

When I first looked at AWS Lambda it was very unclear to me how to structure and deploy a Lambda based application. I'm hoping these examples will help others that want to learn more about AWS Lambda.

## Examples
Each branch has a different example. There are complete examples for the [Serverless Framework](http://serverless.com/) and  [Apex Framework](http://apex.run/).
